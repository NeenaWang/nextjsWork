We believe that the power to shape our cities and create a better, more sustainable future lies within each and every one of us. That's why we've created **SoCity**, a non-profit DAO that brings together communities, individuals and organizations in cities to drive positive change through prosocial and pro-sustainability behaviors. At the heart of SoCity is an innovative paradigm with decentralized incentive policy. By quantifying each participant's social and sustainable value contribution, monetizing it, and providing rewards to further strengthen positive feedback loops, we create a dynamic, self-reinforcing system that drives real change in cities. By leveraging the power of decentralization, SoCity empowers individuals to drive positive change and shape a better living environment. With awareness, empowerment and trust, we believe that everyone can make a real impact and create a brighter future for us all.

**Why Individual Behaviors?**
In most of the built environment, such an approach has the following characteristics:

- **Sustainability**: Individual behaviors, such as using public transportation, conserving energy, and reducing waste, can have a more lasting impact on the environment than construction-focused solutions. By encouraging individuals to adopt sustainable habits and practices, cities can create a more sustainable future.
- **Resilience**: Individual behaviors are more flexible and adaptable than construction-focused solutions, which can be expensive, time-consuming, and difficult to change. Encouraging individuals to adopt new behaviors allows cities to respond more quickly and effectively to changing needs and conditions.
- **Community building**: Encouraging individual behaviors can promote community building and social engagement. For example, community-based initiatives to encourage recycling, volunteering, or other prosocial behaviors can bring people together and foster a sense of community and social connection.
- **Personal ownership**: Encouraging individual behaviors places responsibility for improving the environment on the individual, rather than on the government or other organizations. This can promote personal ownership and investment in the community and its well-being.
