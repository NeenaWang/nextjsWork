**What is DAO?**
You might have already heard the term dao/daoism - an ancient Chinese philosophy to explore the way of being and seek approaches to live in harmony and balance with the world. When it comes to the modern cyber era, an emerging way of working and interaction with people around the world has gathered attention - decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This new organizational form provides a space for its members to collaborate for a common goal/value without a central governing body. The DAO is operating based on multilaterally agreed smart contract and is able to mobilize efficient and transparent bottom-up governance through blockchains and cryptocurrency technology. The DAO features some distinct characteristics:

- **Decentralized** in contrast to the traditional hierarchical organizations such as company, DAO is a structure that is **community-owned**, and managed through bottom-up approach. Each member is able to showcase their voice and participate in the decision-making and governance.

- **Autonomous** the shared community rules are encoded on the blockchain via smart contract, a DAO community is able to implement automatic operation or financial transaction with few people management.

- **Transparent** the blockchain technology enables DAO to create a trusted and transparent environment for every member. All information is publicly viewable including proposals, votes and decisions etc. Every member is encouraged to participate in the community building.

- **Borderless** in this digital native community, like-minded people around the globe regardless of their background are able to join the borderless collaboration for a shared goal.

- **Diversified** other than investment and fundraising purpose, DAOs are experimenting their scope through diverse activities: redefining social network and community, innovating digital arts, entertainment and culture, and initiating philanthropy and social good practices, you name it.
